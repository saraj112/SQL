#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT count(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#4. Which Product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?


SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in(SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales)

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
GROUP BY product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT sum(quantity) ,product,sum(quantity)*price as revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity >2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#1. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, sum(quantity) 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product

#1. Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).

SELECT distinct location, count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location like'%NY%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING count(orderID) >2 


#2. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?


SELECT sum(quantity)as quantity,product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE product like '%headphone%'
GROUP BY product


#3.What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)


SELECT avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
on Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


#4.What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).

SELECT sum(quantity)/count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
on Feb.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'



#5. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT product, sum(price*quantity) as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Sum(price*quantity) desc
LIMIT 1
